# AI-Hackathon
The AI Hackathon’s goals are to build event pros’ real-world AI skills, foster hands-on learning and collaboration, create shareable resources and portfolio work, showcase new AI-driven event possibilities, and model effective, sustainable team processes—while addressing real-life constraints and sharing findings back to the industry.
